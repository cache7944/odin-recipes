A simple project to demonstrate what I have learned so far. 
            
## Introduction
This is my first project.   
This year I started the Web development journey. I'm working on this project now to showcase what I have learned based on the instruction of "The Odin Project".  
I've already learned theories about the Internet and the Web, the basic tools needed to do Web development, and recently, the basics of command lines, Git and HTML.  
This project will help me consolidate what I have learned.
